# Invertible Counterpoint Calculator üéº

A simple C# console application that calculates **intervallic relationships under inversion**.  

This tool automates a process that normally takes a lot of manual effort: working out which intervals stay consonant or dissonant when voices are inverted at a given interval (e.g., at the octave, tenth, or twelfth).  

Perfect for students of counterpoint, composers, and anyone exploring how to structure **fugues, canons, and invertible counterpoint** without doing all the tedious hand-calculations.

## üîß How it Works
- You enter a **JV (inversion index)**, e.g. `-3` or `4`.  
- The program computes, for each possible interval:
  - **Fixed Consonances** ‚Üí intervals that stay consonant after inversion  
  - **Fixed Dissonances** ‚Üí intervals that stay dissonant after inversion  
  - **Variable Consonances** ‚Üí intervals that are consonant before inversion but become dissonant after  
  - **Variable Dissonances** ‚Üí intervals that are dissonant before inversion but become consonant after  

This classification is fundamental to species counterpoint and to understanding which voice-leading moves are possible when inverting subjects in fugues or building canons at the interval.
